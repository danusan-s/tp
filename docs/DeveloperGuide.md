## Design & implementation
{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### "Add" Command Feature
The "AddCommand" is responsible for adding fields and records to the inventory. 
Concurrently, "add" command is implemented with behaviour to update CSV file to persist changes made to inventory.
This command supports the following options:
* '-h': Add custom fields to the inventory.
* '-d': Add records to the inventory corresponding to defined fields.
* '-hu': Updates fields in the inventory.

#### Architecture Overview
The 'AddCommand' is part of the `command` package, and interacts with the following key components:
* **Inventory**: Contains the current state of the inventory, including fields and records.
* **Csv**: Handles reading from and writing to the CSV file for data storage persistence.
* **Ui**: Handles user interactions component such as message to user during command execution.

Command flow of 'AddCommand' can be visualized with the following architecture diagram:

#### Component-Level Design
"AddCommand" Class:
* processes the input arguments and executes the logic based on flags (-h, -d, -hu) respectively.
* fields and records are validated before updating inventory data into the CSV file.

"AddCommand" Methods:
* handleAddMultipleFields(): processes input fields, validate fields, and update the inventory accordingly.
* handleAddRecord(): handles logic for adding records into the inventory. If successfully add records, data will be appended into the CSV file.
* handleUpdateFields(): allow updating of existing fields and types in the inventory.

#### Sequence Diagram
*Illustrates how "AddCommand" interacts with "Inventory" and "Csv" classes when adding a record:

#### Why Implement "AddCommand" in this way?
Separating implementation of "AddCommand", "Inventory", and "Csv" classes ensures:
* "AddCommand" focus only on processing input and delegating task to other specific components.
* "Csv" class is responsible for updating data into CSV file for storage; ensuring persistence in data control.
* With this breakdown of implementation, create room for future scalability (e.g. adding more fields types).

#### Alternative Considered
Only when requirements permits, database implementation has been considered for better handling of fields types for inventory storage.

### "Delete" Command Feature
The "DeleteCommand" is responsible for adding fields and records to the inventory. 
Concurrently, "delete" command is implemented with behaviour to update CSV file to persist changes made to inventory.
This command supports the following formats:
* '\<index>': Delete the record at the specified index (1-based indexing).
* '-a': Delete all records in the inventory. 
* '-e': Delete all records and headers in the inventory.
* '-h \<field_name>': Delete the mentioned field and its column from the inventory.
* '-r \<start>-\<end>': Delete records from the start index to the end index (both inclusive and 1-based indexing).

#### Design
##### Architecture Overview
The 'DeleteCommand' is part of the `command` package, and interacts with the following key components:
* **Inventory**: Contains the current state of the inventory, including fields and records.
* **Csv**: Handles reading from and writing to the CSV file for data storage persistence.
* **Ui**: Handles user interactions component such as message to user during command execution.

##### Component-Level Design
"DeleteCommand" Class:
* processes the input arguments and executes the logic based on if the second argument is a number or flag.
* fields and records are validated before updating inventory data into the CSV file.

#### Implementation Details:

##### Delete Single record:

* The `deleteRecord` method in the `DeleteCommand` class is responsible for deleting a single record from the inventory.
* The method uses one based indexing and first checks if the index is valid.
* If the index is valid, the record is removed from the inventory and the CSV file is updated.
* We used one based indexing to make it more intuitive for the user to delete records based on the serial numbers on the list.

Step 1: Initial state of the inventory

Step 2: User enters the command `delete 1`

Step 3: The delete command checks if it has necessary number of arguments.

Step 4: The delete command checks if the argument is a number.

Step 5: The delete command checks if 1 is within the bounds of the inventory.
 
Step 6: The delete command deletes the record at index 1.

#### Alternative Considered
Giving each product an unique serial number and using that to delete from the inventory.
- This required the users to define the serial numbers and made it more complex.

## Product scope
### Target user profile
* Small to medium-sized business owners operating as retail stores, warehouses, or online shops.
* Owners seeking a customizable, command-driven system to efficiently manage inventory and optimize workflows can leverage on Inventra.

### Value proposition

Inventra provides a fast, command-line driven logistics and inventory management system, allowing a single user to do stock tracking, order management, and operational insights, ensuring quick and snappy access to critical business data.

## Non-Functional Requirements
* The system should work across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
* Data must be persistent across sessions by saving and fetching from/to a CSV file.

## Glossary

* *CSV* - Comma-separated values, a format used to store data in a table that are separated by commas
* *Inventory* - Collections of items defined based on their associated properties (fields) - for example: product name, quantity, ...).

## Instructions for manual testing
1. Adding Fields
* Run command: "add -h s/name, i/quantity, f/price" to add new fields to inventory
* Verify: "view -a"

2. Adding Records
* Run command: "add -d Apple, 100, 1.5"
* Verify: "view -a"

3. View Records
* To view all records in inventory, run command: "view -a"
* To view specific records in inventory by ID, in this case ID = 1, run command: "view 1"  
* To view records by string, in this case find string "Apple", run command: "view -f Apple"

4. Delete Records
* To delete ID = 1, run command: "delete 1"
* To delete all records, run command: "delete -a"
* To delete entire table (inventory), run command "delete -e"
* Verify: "view -a"

5. CSV Persistence (data storage)
* After add or delete fields/records, check CSV file (inventory.csv) for update

6. Exit Program
* Run command: "exit"
